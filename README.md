## 3. Installation

To run Tweet Explorer locally on your machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/dayarmush/tweet-explorer) URL.

Navigate to the project directory.

Install the required dependencies using the package manager of your choice:
`npm install`

Start the JSON Server to simulate the backend with the following command:
`npm run json-server --watch new-db.json`

In a separate terminal or command prompt, run the app locally:
`npm start`

The npm run json-server command will start the JSON Server and serve the tweet data from the provided JSON file. It will act as the backend API for your Tweet Explorer app during the development phase.
